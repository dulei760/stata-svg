    <h1>Stata commands for manipulating SVG graphics</h1>
    <h2>Semi-transparency</h2>
    <h3>To do</h3>

    <h2>Hexagonal binning</h2>
    <h3>To do</h3>

    <h2>Embedding in HTML with JavaScript to get some interactivity</h2>
    <h3>To do</h3>
    <p>We have used D3 here but we could do it without that</p>
    <p>We should allow an option to include all JS libraries inside the one .html file</p>
    <p>We should think about ways of linking other variables in superimposed twoway plots</p>

    <h2>Background utilities</h2>
    <h3>svgtag</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>To do</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add classes: xaxis, yaxis, xtitle, ytitle, xtick, ytick, xlabel, ylabel, gridline, line, area, markers other than circles, markerlabel, rspike, rcapupper, rcaplower</li>
      <li>add comment block containing Stata code that would read the coordinates of the data in: both the pixels and the original variable values, also the pixels for the plotregion</li>
      <li>add option to allocate different classes to markers and lines depending on their color</li>
      <li>add option to allocate different classes to markers and lines, given the number of observations in each superimposed graph</li>
    </ul>
